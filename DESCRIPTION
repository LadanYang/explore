Description: |
  This package takes a data set as user input and creates visualizations. 
  Optionally, functions will also take a variable and produce plots based on 
  the type of variable. Basic explore functions take statistical data and output 
  interactive scatterplots, linegraphs, boxplots, histograms, and more to illustrate 
  the distribution of one numeric or categorical variable or the relationship between 
  multiple variables. Spatial functions take polygon/multipolygon or point data and 
  output scaled, gradient, geometric mapping, or dot and heat mapping. Neural 
  functions take the neural spiking data (first column spiking time/location, 
  second column trials number or neuron number) and create a raster plot with perievent histogram.
