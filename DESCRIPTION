Description: This package will take a data set as user input and create visualizations.  
Optionally, functions will also take a variable and produce plots based on the type of variable.  
Basic explore functions take statistical data and outputs histograms, boxplots, line graphs and scatterplots.  
Spatial functions take polygon/multipolygon or point data and outputs scaled, gradient, geometric mapping or dot and heat mapping.  
Neural functions take the neural spiking data (first column spiking time/location, second column trials number or neuron number),
and create a raster plot with perievent histogram.
