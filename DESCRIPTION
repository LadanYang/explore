Description: This package will take a data set as user input and create
    visualizations.  Optionally, functions will also take a variable and
    produce plots based on the type of variable.  Basic explore functions
    take statistical data and outputs histograms, boxplots, line graphs
    and scatterplots.  Spatial functions take polygon/multipolygon or
    point data and outputs scaled, gradient, geometric mapping or dot and
    heat mapping.  Neural functions take the neural spiking data (first
    column spiking time/location, second column trials number or neuron
    number), and create a raster plot with perievent histogram.
